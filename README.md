# Point Count data from the Ottawa Bird Count

## Ottawa Bird Count

The Ottawa Bird Count (OBC) is a designed survey of the birds in the urban and suburban areas of Ottawa. The OBC includes a point count program that includes over 900 survey points located across the city in a stratified random design. There is one survey point within each cell of a 1km x 1km grid, located at a randomly chosen publicly accessible location (most are adjacent to roads or public pathways). These points are grouped into approximately 100 survey routes, and an observer visits the points in each survey route in a predetermined order on one morning during the peak breeding season for the Ottawa region (May 24 - July 7). At each of the survey points along the route, the observer conducts a 10-minute point count survey. The observation protocol involves recording each bird seen or heard during the 10-minute count, and the observations are recorded within two distance bins (0 - 75 m from the point, and \>75 m from the point) and 5 two-minute time-of-detection bins (i.e., 0-2 minutes, 2-4 minutes, 4-6 minutes, etc.). Only the first observation of each individual bird is recorded, so subsequent observations of birds in later time-of-detection bins or distance bins are ignored. This protocol allows the data to be anlaysed using both time-of-detection (often referred to as "removal") models to estimate the availability of birds and detection-distance models to estimate the variation in perceptibility of birds with increasing distance [@sÃ³lymos2013][@amundson2014]. The routes are only surveyed during suitable weather (low or no wind and no precipitation) and each route survey-event begins 30-minutes before local sunrise (beginning of the first point count on the route) and subsequent point counts are visited in quick succession in the predetermined order.

Additional data on the number of vehicles passing the observer (e.g., background noise), weather, time-of-day, and survey date are recorded that may also provide useful covariates of perceptibility and availability.

## Years with data

The Ottawa Bird Count started in 2007, and most surveys were conducted during the years 2007 - 2013. There were a few surveys conducted during the years 2013-2018, and then the field program has been suspended since 2019. The program will re-start in the field season of 2027, when all of the original point count locations will be re-surveyed with the intention of estimating 20-year changes in the city's bird populations.

## Data column descriptions

Birds observed outside of 75 m were recorded separately from birds inside and without the time-bins during the first few years of the program.

## Example data extraction

Note, here I'll load the tidyverse package, which is entirely optional but I like to use for data manipulation.

The point count data can be read into an R session using `readRDS()`.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

all_data <- readRDS("OBC_point_count_data.rds")

names(all_data)
```

The various dataframes can be joined using the common column names with the "_id" suffixes. 

For example, if we wanted to select all of the point count surveys conducted during the field season of 2008.

```{r}

surveys_08 <- all_data[["route_observation"]] %>% 
  filter(year == 2008)
names(surveys_08)
```
This extracts all of the survey event information for point count routes surveyed during the 2008 field season. There are `r nrow(surveys_08)` rows in the `surveys_08` dataframe and therefore `r nrow(surveys_08)` routes surveyed that year. The values in the column `route_observation_id` are used to link these route survey events to the point count locations in the `route_point` dataframe, the point-level observation conditions in the `route_point_observation` dataframe, and the bird observations collected during these surveys in the `species_point_observation_count` dataframe. 

First, I'll join the route survey information from 2008 to the point count location information. 

```{r}

point_counts_08 <- surveys_08 %>% 
  left_join(.,all_data[["route_point"]],
             multiple = "all",
            by = "route_id")


```

In 2008, there were a total of `r nrow(point_counts_08)` point count locations on the routes that were surveyed. It is possible (probable) that some of these locations were not actually surveyed due to safety, logistical, or changing weather conditions. We will now compare these point count locations to the route_point_observation data.

First, we select all of the route_point_observation data associated with the survey events on the routes surveyed in 2008, and filter out those with a missing data on start-time (indicating they were not actually surveyed).

```{r}
points_counts_surveyed_2008 <- all_data[["route_point_observation"]] %>% 
  filter(route_observation_id %in% point_counts_08$route_observation_id,
         !is.na(start_time))

```

There were `r nrow(point_counts_08) - nrow(point_counts_surveyed_2008)` point counts on the routes surveyed in 2008, that for some reason could not be surveyed that year.

Now, we collect the bird observations from those point count surveys. We will join the point_count_surveyed_2008 dataframe to the bird observations in a way that ensures all of the appropriate zeroes are added to the database (zero-counts of species not observed at all during a particular point count).

To do that, first we get the full set of bird observations from 2008. 

```{r}

birds_observed_2008 <- all_data[["species_point_observation_count"]] %>% 
  filter(route_point_observation_id %in% points_counts_surveyed_2008$route_point_observation_id) 

```

Then we combine the full list of species observed with the full list of point counts surveyed to generate a full dataframe with a unique row for each species and each point count survey. 

```{r}
species_list_2008 <- birds_observed_2008 %>% 
  select(species_id) %>% 
  distinct()

route_point_obs_2008 <- birds_observed_2008 %>% 
  select(route_point_observation_id) %>% 
  distinct()

full_species_point_dataframe <- expand_grid(route_point_obs_2008,species_list_2008)

```

Then we join the bird observation information to this full dataframe and replace the missing counts with 0 values.

```{r}


observations_w_zeroes <- full_species_point_dataframe %>% 
  left_join(.,birds_observed_2008,
            by = c("species_id","route_point_observation_id"))%>% 
  left_join(.,all_data[["species"]],
            by = "species_id") %>% 
  mutate(true_zeros = ifelse(is.na(count_0),TRUE,FALSE),
         count_0 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_0),
         count_2 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_2),
         count_4 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_4),
         count_6 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_6),
         count_8 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_8),
         count_75 = ifelse(true_zeros & !is.na(count_75),
                          0,count_75),
         count_75_0 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_75_0),
         count_75_2 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_75_2),
         count_75_4 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_75_4),
         count_75_6 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_75_6),
         count_75_8 = ifelse(true_zeros,
                          0,count_75_8))

```


This `observations_w_zeroes` dataframe now includes all bird observations, with the appropriate zero values for species that were absent during a given point count.
